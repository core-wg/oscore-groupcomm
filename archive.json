      "body": "I think we need some more discussion of which signature algorithms to use. Candidates would be:\r\n\r\nAlgorithm                 Signature size    Security level\r\nECDSA secp224r1 (P-224)   56 bytes          112\r\nECDSA secp256r1 (P-256)   64 bytes          128\r\nECDSA secp256k1           64 bytes          128\r\nEd25519                   64 bytes          128\r\n\r\nThe CFRG review of EDHOC brought up the qeustion if not P-224 would be a better choice if the main goal is to get smaller messages. ECDSA with P-224 has the obvious advantage of having signatures that are 8 bytes shorter.\r\n\r\n112-bit security is according to NIST ok to use until 2030.\r\n\r\nECDSA wih P-224 is significantly faster than ECDSA with P-256, around 2/3 the number of operations/time. secp256k1 is around 300 % faster than secp256r1. Harder to find comparisions with Ed25519. Most of the speed will depend on the curve, but EdDSA (Schnorr) also have other advantages that speed up signing compared to ECDSA. Ed25519 verify is likely at least as fast as ECDSA with P-224 on all platforms and significantly faster for signing on all platforms. On some platforms I think Ed25519 is significantly faster also for verification.\r\n\r\nIn terms of number of implementation, I think ECDSA with P-256 in is the lead, with ECDSA P-224 as second, and Ed25519 in last place.\r\n\r\nI am leaning towards that P-224 should probably be supported (then ES224 need to be standardized in COSE). The other three are already registered for COSE. The harder question is which should be MTI. Several people have stated that latency is of uthermost importance, in case the current choice of Ed25519 as MTI is likely the correct choice.\r\n\r\nA good but a little bit dated comparision of different algorithms on ARM processors:\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/92/materials/slides-92-lwig-3\r\n\r\nThe choice also depends on if there are fast implementations available. Assembly optimized version of the NIST curves is likely as fast or faster than a curve25519 implementation written in C.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc has very fast implementations (for ARM) of ECDH and ECDSA with secp160r1, secp192r1, secp224r1, secp256r1, and secp256k1. I cannot find anything similar for EdDSA.\r\n",

It is not mentioned in the Group OSCORE document, and I do not think there was any discussion ending in that the use case should not be supported.\r\n\r\nUse case description from Jim Schaad:\r\n\r\n> \r\n> I have a room full of light bulbs and switches which constitute a multicast group.  For various reasons these devices do not both doing any signature checking.  There are some additional controllers that live outside of the subnet which consists of the room which need to be able to control the devices and query the state of various devices in the that subsystem.  \r\n>     \r\n> There lives a firewall/gateway on the border between the subsystem and the entire network that wants to prevent unauthenticated commands coming in from the outside or information which is not authenticated leaking out from the inside.  The first way to do this is to make the firewall/gateway be a traffic re-writing system.  That means that it will receive commands from the outside, authenticate them, translate them to a command the will work inside of the room and sends it.  It will then deal with the responses and translate them back to a format that the original device would understand and authenticate.\r\n>     \r\n> The second way is to say that the firewall/gateway is not a trusted party to this situation.  However, there is a desire to drastically cut down the attack space that is coming from the outside world into the room.  In this case when the gateway receives a request, it validates the signature on the group message and ensures that it is signed by a member of the group.  It does this by checking the counter signature on the message, but does not try and decrypt the message.  At that point it lets the message into the room where it will be acted on by the local devices.  It would also be possible that the responses would be signed by the firewall/gateway rather than each individual device providing a signature.  \r\n>     \r\n>  For the second method, any data which is not determinable by the firewall without being a member of the group with the exception of the signing key, is going to be a problem as the signature cannot validated.

The first use case seems quite straightforward to achieve and likely worth making sure it works with Group OSCORE. The firewall still need to be able to fetch information from somewhere, but does not need to be trusted. The second use case is more complicated as the firewall need to be semi-trusted, and there the construction also changes the meaning of the Sender ID as it is now the firewall that has signed rather than the original sender.\r\n",

The first case, on the contrary, is not necessarily a group OSCORE case. There could be a group OSCORE between the gateway and the firewall/gateway, but that is not fundamental to the scenario: here the middle node is trusted on one side by the external controller, on the other side by the multicast group. He could be considered the endpoint for those communications.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest we only describe the second case.",

If that is responded to with an own sequence number (which'll be the case in groupcomm -- on original OSCORE we couldn't enforce that), that is known fresh to the original server, and it can initialize its replay window. This depends on the availability of role reversal and the absence of proxies, so I'd only flesh this out if it solves a real problem.",

This make Group OSCORE impossible to use in many situations such as the 75 bytes in some cellular network broadcast (even with CCM_8).\r\n \r\nIt would be very strange to force people wanting to use AES-CCM, AES-GCM, or ChaCha20-Poly1305 or other 16-bit tag algorithms in pair-wise to use 80-byte source authentication, when it can trivially by done with 64 bytes. While the TLS conclusions regarding CCM_8 is misleading, I think there will be a trend toward 128 bit tags. Many deployments for government and financial institutions always use 128 bit tags.\r\n\r\nAnother big disadvantage with the current design is that the user to chose between more useless in the signature mode and less security in pair-wise. In the signature mode, the tag provides no security and you want as small as possible. For pair-wise many application would definitly want to use 16 bytes tags, e.g. application aligning with the CSNA suite.\r\n\r\n8-16 additional bytes overhead for the signature mode makes a big difference.

From a general point of view, this relates to the issue at https://github.com/core-wg/core-responses/issues/2\r\n\r\n* Improved presentation of the security properties ensured by Group OSCORE, by following more closely the parlance and structure used for OSCORE in RFC 8613.\r\n\r\n* Improved listing of operations defined for the group mode that are inherited by the pairwise mode.\r\n\r\n* Have \"SHOULD\" (not \"MUST\") for using the group mode to protect a request intended to multiple recipients.

The library provides also utility programs.\r\n\r\n* Implementation's level of maturity: Stable support for OSCORE; Group OSCORE is WIP.\r\n\r\n* The implementation supports:\r\n\r\n  * The group mode and the pairwise mode.\r\n  * Mapping of public keys for the curve Ed25519 into Montgomery coordinates to use with X25519.\r\n  * The following COSE encryption algorithms: 1-3, 10-13, 24, 30-33\r\n  * The following HKDF algorithms: HKDF SHA-256, -384, -512.\r\n  * The following COSE signature algorithms: EdDSA on Ed25519, ECDSA w/ SHA-256 on P-256\r\n  * The following COSE key agreement algorithms: ECDH on P-256 and curve25519.\r\n  * The following authentication credential format: currently n/a (user provides pairs of credentials and keys)\r\n\r\n* Version compatibility: -23\r\n\r\n* Licensing: MIT\r\n\r\n* Implementation experience: Mostly smooth; the differentiation between the regular and the group AEAD algorithm was tedious and error prone (because Group OSCORE largely relies on OSCORE extension points that were anticipated, but that was not).\r\n\r\n* Contact information: Christian Ams\u00fcss - christian@amsuess.com\r\n\r\n* Information last updated on: 2024-12-17\r\n```",
